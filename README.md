# History Trivia

This is a history knowledge trivia game that shows only one question until the player answers it or their time runs out. If the player selects the correct answer, the message "Correct!" will show along with a gif. After a few seconds, the next question is displayed.

If the player runs out of time, the player is told that time's up and the correct answer is displayed. The game will then be over.

If the player chooses the wrong answer they are told "Nope! The correct answer is" and the correct answer is displayed along with the gif.
